# Final Project for CS 151: Logic Programming (Spr 2023)

Project Description: CS 151 introduces basic logic programming theory, current technology, and examples of common applications, notably deductive databases, logical spreadsheets, enterprise management, computational law, and game playing. Here is a bit about our final project for the course: College students have little time to enjoy reading for leisure and rarely have the bandwidth to enrich themselves with written texts other than textbooks. Students are also overburdened with academic text and need help to keep themselves accountable to reignite reading for fun again. There are also no comprehensive or logic-based reading logs out there that are geared toward college students. We aim to solve this issue by providing a worksheet that enables the logging of books and a way to keep track of book series, set personal reading goals, and explore new genres and languages.

# Final Project for CS 109: Probability for Computer Scientists (Fall 2023)

About "The Probability Challenge": CS 109 teaches the applications of probability in computer science including machine learning and the use of probability in the analysis of algorithms. Each year they host the Stanford CS109 Probability for Computer Scientist Challenge. For the challenge, create a probability driven project of your choosing that highlights concepts from the class and does something interesting. An entry consists of a screen capture and a short write-up of the probability theory behind your work. 

Project Description: In the realm of professional tennis, the conclusion of each match unveils a series of statistics, offering a glimpse into the players' performance. These statistics, which include winners, unforced errors, and serve percentages, have long intrigued me. They raise a question: can these figures alone, without directly watching the match, predict the winner? This report is an exploration of this hypothesis, delving into the predictive power of match statistics in tennis, particularly focusing on the renowned rivalry between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

# Final Project for CS 221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques (Fall 2023)

About the Final Project: CS 221 focuses on the foundational concepts that drive these applications. Specific topics include search, constraint satisfaction, game playing, Markov decision processes, graphical models, machine learning, and logic. For the final project, you will build a system to solve a well-defined task. Which task you choose is completely open-ended, but the methods you use should draw on the ones from the course.

Project Description: Our project delves into the fascinating field of image recognition, specifically focusing on identifying and finding images of dogs that closely resemble a given input image. This is similar to the feature on popular online retail platforms such as Amazon, where customers are shown products similar to the one they are viewing. Our approach harnesses the power of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a well-established method in machine learning, on the Stanford Dogs dataset. Our system can accurately pinpoint and return images of dogs that bear the most resemblance to the input image.

This project isn't only about matching images; it addresses a real-world need in various sectors. For veterinarians, it offers a tool to correctly identify dog breeds, which is crucial in diagnosing breed-specific ailments and prescribing appropriate treatments. Similarly, potential dog owners exploring different breeds for their future pets can benefit immensely from this technology. It aids in understanding the physical traits of various breeds, helping them make an informed decision.
